DMFB-simulator
==============
This is a Digital Microfluidic Biochip (DMFB) simulator. It takes a file which contains activation sequences information and then demostrates behaviours of the chip.
This project is carried out for the purpose of developing new algorithm to reduce the number of control pins in DMFB.
