DMFB-simulator
==============
A js-based Digital Microfluidic Biochip (DMFB) simulator. 
It takes a file which contains actuation sequences of allocated pins as input and demonstrates the behaviours of the chip.
This project is carried out for the purpose of researching and developing new alogorithm to reduce the number of control pins.
