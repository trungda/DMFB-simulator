Droplet movement display utility
==============
This is a Digital Microfluidic Biochip (DMFB) simulator. It takes a file which contains activation sequences information and then demostrates behaviours of the chip.
This project is carried out for the purpose of developing new algorithm for pin-constrained DMFB.
